  ## nc99 Minecraft Server

The nc99 Minecraft Server is a small community Minecraft server with a focus on simplicity, freedom, and ambitious projects.

We have been hosting Minecraft servers since 2012. We currently play on a long-running vanilla server and host modded servers from time to time. Feel free to browse through this website to get an idea of what we're about, and we'd love to have you [apply to be whitelisted](/apply) if you're interested!
