The nc99 Minecraft server is a small community server hosted in a home in California since 2012. Throughout the years, we've hosted many types of Minecraft servers, including a public Bukkit server, several modded servers, and a private vanilla server. We continue to host Minecraft servers and hope to provide a much needed relief from servers that have been overrun with annoying plugins and abusive moderators.

All staff play on servers along with everyone else and are not allowed any extra in-game advantages. This way, we become a server run by the players, for the players. On our servers, we try to have very few rules in order to give as much freedom as possible but without it hurting others.

## Staff

All staff are volunteers. We are all currently university students, attending various universities around the world. Staff may be able to remotely access the server console to resolve issues, or otherwise contact someone who can.

## Contact

If you have any issues or questions, please email [support@nc99.co](mailto:support@nc99.co).

## Funding

All server costs, including electricity and domain registration, are covered privately. All maintenance is done on a volunteer basis. We do not currently accept online donations. As this service is provided for free, all that we ask is that players are respectful to each other and staff.

## Technical Details

The server runs Ubuntu and was custom built in 2012. The current specs are:

- **CPU** - AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor
- **RAM** - 2x16GB DDR4 at 3200 MHz (32GB total)
- **Motherboard** - GIGABYTE X570 I AORUS PRO WIFI AMD Ryzen 3000 PCIe 4.0 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.2 AMD X570 Mini-ITX Motherboard
- **Storage** - 128 GB NVMe SSD

Currently, we have a gigabit symmetric connection. We are located in Berkeley, CA so geographical distance from here can also be a factor in lag, although international users from Europe have been successful in playing on a public modded server in the past (when we were in Mountain View, CA).
