Welcome to the new website for the nc99 Minecraft server. Ditching our old Django based website (and Wordpress before that), the new website is statically generated and based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which should hopefully make it more maintainable going forward. We hope this website is a useful resource for our existing members and serves as a good introduction for others that are interested in joining. 

This website is released under an open source license, and its source code is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/nicolaschan/nc99.co), if you're interested. Opening issues and making contributions in the form of pull requests are very welcome.
